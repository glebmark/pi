What is ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)?	A protocol that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network. When a device needs to send a frame, it broadcasts "who has IP X?" and the owner replies with its MAC address.
What is CIDR notation (e.g., /24)?	Classless Inter-Domain Routing — a way to express an IP address and its network mask together. /24 means the first 24 bits are the network portion, leaving 8 bits (256 addresses) for hosts. Example: 192.168.86.0/24.
What is a default gateway?	The IP address of the router that a device sends packets to when the destination is outside its local subnet. All non-local traffic gets forwarded to the gateway.
What is NAT (Network Address Translation)?	A technique where a router rewrites source/destination IP addresses in packets as they pass through. Commonly used to let many private-IP devices share a single public IP (SNAT/masquerade).
What is the difference between SNAT and DNAT?	SNAT (Source NAT) changes the source IP of outgoing packets (e.g., masquerading private IPs behind a public IP). DNAT (Destination NAT) changes the destination IP of incoming packets (e.g., port forwarding to an internal server).
What is MASQUERADE in iptables?	A special case of SNAT where the source IP is dynamically set to the outgoing interface's current IP. Useful when the outgoing IP is assigned by DHCP and may change.
What is a Linux bridge?	A software-implemented Layer 2 (Ethernet) switch inside the kernel. It connects multiple virtual or physical network interfaces, forwarding frames between them based on MAC addresses.
How does a Linux bridge differ from a router?	A bridge operates at Layer 2 (MAC addresses, Ethernet frames). A router operates at Layer 3 (IP addresses, IP packets). Bridges forward within a broadcast domain; routers forward between different networks.
What is bridged traffic in the context of Linux networking?	Network traffic that passes through a Linux bridge (software switch). Containers connected to the same bridge communicate via bridged traffic.
What is a MAC address?	A 48-bit hardware address burned into a network interface (e.g., d8:3a:dd:66:ec:3e). Unique per interface, used for Layer 2 communication. Routers and switches use MAC addresses to forward frames on the local network.
What is VXLAN?	Virtual Extensible LAN — a network overlay protocol that encapsulates Layer 2 Ethernet frames in UDP packets. Used by CNI plugins like Cilium (on port 8472) to create a virtual network for pod-to-pod traffic across nodes.
What is an overlay network?	A virtual network built on top of an existing (underlay) network. Encapsulates packets with additional headers to create a logical network topology independent of the physical one. VXLAN and Geneve are overlay protocols used by CNI plugins.
What is the underlay network?	The physical network infrastructure (switches, routers, cables, WiFi) that carries the actual packets. Overlay networks ride on top of the underlay by encapsulating their traffic inside standard underlay packets.
What is the difference between overlay and direct routing in CNI?	Overlay (VXLAN/Geneve): encapsulates pod traffic in UDP — works anywhere, adds overhead. Direct routing: pod IPs are natively routable on the network (no encapsulation) — lower overhead, but requires L3 routing support on the network.
What is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)?	The L3 routing protocol that runs the internet. Routers exchange route announcements to determine the best path between autonomous systems (networks). MetalLB can use BGP to advertise Service IPs to upstream routers.
What is a DHCP reservation?	A router-side setting that always assigns the same IP to a specific device based on its MAC address, even though the device still uses DHCP.
What is DHCP and how does the 4-step handshake work?	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol — automatically assigns IP addresses. Steps: 1) DISCOVER (client broadcasts "I need an IP") 2) OFFER (server offers an address) 3) REQUEST (client accepts the offer) 4) ACK (server confirms the lease).
What is a DHCP lease?	A time-limited assignment of an IP address. The client must renew before the lease expires (typically at 50% and 87.5% of the lease time) or lose the address.
What is NTP and what problem does it solve?	Network Time Protocol — synchronises system clocks over the network. Without it, clocks drift (crystal oscillators are imperfect), which breaks time-sensitive protocols like TLS certificate validation, Kerberos, and distributed consensus.
What are NTP stratum levels?	A hierarchy indicating distance from the reference clock. Stratum 0: atomic clocks, GPS receivers. Stratum 1: directly connected to stratum 0. Stratum 2: syncs from stratum 1, etc. Higher stratum = less accurate.
What protocol allows resolving `rara.local` on the local network without a DNS server?	mDNS (Multicast DNS)
What daemon provides mDNS on Raspberry Pi OS?	Avahi (avahi-daemon)
What UDP port does mDNS use for hostname announcements?	5353
What is the macOS/Apple equivalent of Avahi for mDNS resolution?	Bonjour
What are the 7 layers of the OSI model? (top to bottom)	7) Application (HTTP, DNS, SSH) 6) Presentation (TLS/SSL, encoding) 5) Session (connection management) 4) Transport (TCP, UDP) 3) Network (IP, ICMP, routing) 2) Data Link (Ethernet, MAC, ARP, switches) 1) Physical (cables, radio, electrical signals)
What happens at Layer 1 (Physical)?	Transmits raw bits over a physical medium — electrical signals (copper), light pulses (fiber), or radio waves (WiFi). Defines connectors, voltages, frequencies. No addressing or error checking. Examples: Ethernet cables, WiFi radio.
What happens at Layer 2 (Data Link)?	Frames data for transmission between directly connected nodes on the same network segment. Uses MAC addresses for addressing. Handles frame synchronisation, error detection (CRC), and media access control. Examples: Ethernet, WiFi (802.11), ARP.
What happens at Layer 3 (Network)?	Routes packets across network boundaries using logical addresses (IP). Handles addressing, routing, fragmentation, and TTL. Routers operate at L3. Examples: IPv4, IPv6, ICMP.
What is the key difference between Layer 2 and Layer 3?	L2 (Data Link) handles communication within a single network segment using MAC addresses — local only. L3 (Network) handles communication across different networks using IP addresses — enables internetworking/routing.
What happens at Layer 4 (Transport)?	Provides end-to-end communication between applications. TCP offers reliable, ordered delivery with flow control. UDP offers fast, connectionless delivery with no guarantees. Ports distinguish different services on the same host.
What happens at Layer 7 (Application)?	The layer closest to the user. Protocols that applications use directly: HTTP (web), DNS (name resolution), SSH (remote shell), SMTP (email). Deals with data formatting, authentication, and application semantics.
How does a packet traverse the OSI layers when you curl a website?	App creates HTTP request (L7) → TCP segments it (L4) → IP adds source/dest addresses (L3) → Ethernet wraps in a frame with MAC addresses (L2) → NIC converts to electrical/radio signals (L1). Reversed on the receiving end.
What does "L4 load balancing" mean?	Routing traffic based on Layer 4 information: IP addresses and TCP/UDP port numbers. The load balancer doesn't inspect the application payload — it just distributes connections. Faster than L7 but can't route based on HTTP paths/headers.
What does "L7 load balancing" mean?	Routing traffic based on application-layer data: HTTP paths, headers, cookies, gRPC methods. The proxy terminates the connection, inspects the payload, and makes routing decisions. Slower but much more flexible. Envoy is an L7 proxy.
What layer does a Linux bridge operate at?	Layer 2 — it forwards Ethernet frames between interfaces based on MAC addresses, like a virtual switch. It doesn't look at IP addresses unless br_netfilter is enabled (which lifts bridged traffic to L3 iptables).
What is the data plane vs. control plane in networking?	Control plane: makes routing decisions (where should traffic go?). Data plane: actually forwards the packets based on those decisions. In Envoy Gateway: the Gateway API controller is the control plane, Envoy proxy is the data plane.
What is a veth pair?	A pair of virtual Ethernet interfaces connected like a pipe — packets sent to one end appear on the other. Used to connect a container's network namespace to the host's bridge/network. One end goes in the pod, the other in the host namespace.
What is the difference between a self-signed certificate and a CA-signed certificate?	Self-signed: signed by its own key — browsers/clients don't trust it by default (shows warnings). CA-signed: signed by a trusted Certificate Authority — clients trust it because they trust the CA. Self-signed is fine for internal/dev, CA-signed for production.
What is the ACME protocol (used by Let's Encrypt)?	Automated Certificate Management Environment — a protocol for automating TLS certificate issuance. The client proves domain ownership (via HTTP challenge or DNS challenge), and the CA issues a signed certificate automatically.
What does `nmap -sn` do?	Performs a "ping scan" — discovers live hosts on a network without port scanning. Sends ARP requests (on local subnet) or ICMP echo requests to find which IPs are in use.
What does `ip neigh show` display?	The ARP/NDP neighbor table — maps IP addresses to MAC addresses for recently seen devices on the local network. States: REACHABLE (recently confirmed), STALE (old), FAILED (no response), INCOMPLETE (resolving).
What does `ip route` show?	The kernel's routing table — rules for where to send packets based on destination. Shows default gateway, directly connected networks, and any static routes.
What is gRPC?	A high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework by Google that uses Protocol Buffers for serialisation and HTTP/2 for transport. Used by Kubernetes CRI, etcd, and many cloud-native tools.
What is a gratuitous ARP?	An ARP reply broadcast without being solicited by an ARP request. Used to announce an IP-to-MAC mapping to the network, update ARP caches, or detect IP conflicts. MetalLB uses gratuitous ARPs to claim LoadBalancer IPs.
What is ARP filtering on WiFi routers?	Some WiFi routers (e.g., Google WiFi/Nest) only forward ARP responses for IPs in their DHCP table. ARP for unknown IPs is silently dropped, preventing devices from reaching IPs that weren't assigned by the router.
What does an "(incomplete)" ARP entry mean?	The device sent an ARP request but never received a reply. The IP-to-MAC mapping could not be resolved. Common cause: the target IP doesn't exist on the network, or ARP responses are being filtered.
What is a secondary IP address on a network interface?	An additional IP address assigned alongside the primary address on the same interface. The kernel handles ARP and routing for all IPs on the interface. Added via `ip addr add <ip>/32 dev <iface>` or NetworkManager.
What is the difference between a /24 and /32 subnet mask?	/24 = 256 addresses (a network), defines a subnet with host and broadcast addresses. /32 = exactly 1 address (a host route), used for secondary IPs or point-to-point links where no subnet is needed.
What is the iptables FORWARD chain and when does it apply?	Processes packets being routed through the machine (not destined for or originating from it). Applies when a host acts as a router or when Kubernetes forwards external traffic to pods via DNAT.
